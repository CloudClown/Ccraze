	<p>Every 8 seconds someone dies from Sever Acute Malnutrition. There is a solution. MANA (Mother Administered Nutritive Aid) is packaged food that can sustain and cure children suffering from malnutrition. MANA is a peanut paste formulated to meet all of a childâ€™s nutritional needs. It does not require water or cooking. Just three packets a day can save the life of a starving child. We have the solution, but we need help getting them to the kids. </p>
	<p font-weight:bold>By burning calories with and against friends and foes, you can send calories to malnourished children across the world, namely South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. </p
